Search feild near the middle of that page was used to find the Calgary Metro Extract.

A sample of this area is located at "./calgary_canada_sample.osm"

The Map Zen extract includes all of the City of Calgary region as well as many of the surrouding towns
and suburbs.

This area was chosen because it is the area that I live in. I have a decent level of familliarity with the
area and the local language which improves my abilbity to accurately wrangle these map data.
